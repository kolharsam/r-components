# Contribute to r-components

These are components that are built by someone who is very inexperienced but is willing to do go to any length to learn from the
community and provide you all with easy and usable components.

As an outsider, just choose who you want to be:

```javascript
  var outsiders = ["Skeptic", "Friend", "Supporter", "Mentor"]
  outsiders.forEach(function(person) {
      alert('I welcome you all, let's build r-components together")
      console.log("I also do not know why I did this")
  });
```

I will keep going on and please free to leave any comments behind for helping me make the components that the community really wants.
